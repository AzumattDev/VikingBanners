# VikingBanners

Compatible with OdinsBanners!

**This mod was requested by SACK 3000#0939 and ALo#8803**

VikingBanners is a mod that allows you to change the buildable banners texture. You can use URLs to set the banners, or if the server forces the URL it will use that one.

**Version checks with itself. If installed on the server, it will kick clients who do not have it installed.**

**This mod uses ServerSync, if installed on the server and all clients, it will sync all configs with [Synced with Server] tags to client**

**This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.**

`Note: This mod can be installed client only, but will not sync the configuration between clients. Clients can still see other's banners this way. It's only needed on the server if you wish to enforce any of the configuration values that have [Synced with Server] tags.`
